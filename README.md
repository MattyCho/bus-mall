# Bus-Mall

This is a website for a fake company looking to do some market research on "fake" products.
The user is given the opportunity to vote on their favorite products by clicking on an image.
The products will then randomly shuffle with no two products appearing at the same time or copied from the voting round before.
After the user has voted a set number of times, the statistics will appear.
The data will appear in a list format showing the number of votes for each product and how many times they appeared.
The data will also appear in a chart format beneath the list.
If the user leaves the page or refreshes or just wants to vote again, the data will persist in localStorage.
